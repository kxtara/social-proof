## Overview

The desktop version of this challenge was really difficult for me, but I think I did "ok."

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I started with structuring the html and then styling for mobiles and then desktops.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I need to start using CSS Grid; I think the desktop version would've been easier if I did it with CSS Grid.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to continue these challenges because they are very helpful in pointing out things I need to learn.
